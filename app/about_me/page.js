                    <br /><br />
                    <p>I am 20 years old and reside in Le√≥n Guanajuato, Mexico. My journey in programming began at the age of 18. 
                        Through online resources and books, I have honed my skills in programming, with a particular focus on web 
                        development. My passion lies in the creation of Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, as I believe they 
                        offer significant value to the world.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Previously, I was pursuing a degree in accounting, a path influenced by my family's guidance. However, I soon 
                    realized my profound interest in programming and made the bold decision to switch my career path to follow my 
                    passion. During my two years working in an accounting firm, I gained valuable office experience, deepened my 
                    understanding of accounting practices, and refined my professional skills.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am a person who takes calculated risks and is willing to make sacrifices to achieve my goals. Dedicated and studious,
                    I possess a high level of conversational English. Currently, I am seeking an entry-level position in a software company, 
                    where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow professionally.
