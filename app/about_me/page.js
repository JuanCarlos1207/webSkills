                <br /><br />
                <p>I am 20 years old and reside in Le√≥n Guanajuato, Mexico. My journey in programming began at the age of 18. 
                    Through online resources and books, I have honed my skills in programming, with a particular focus on web 
                    development. My passion lies in the creation of Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, as I believe they 
                    offer significant value to the world.
                <br/><br/>
                Previously, I was pursuing a degree in accounting, a path influenced by my family's guidance. However, I soon 
                realized my profound interest in programming and made the bold decision to switch my career path to follow my 
                passion. During my two years working in an accounting firm, I gained valuable office experience, deepened my 
                understanding of accounting practices, and refined my professional skills.
                <br /><br />
                I am a person who takes calculated risks and is willing to make sacrifices to achieve my goals. Dedicated and studious,
                 I possess a high level of conversational English. Currently, I am seeking an entry-level position in a software company, 
                 where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow professionally.
